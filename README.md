# Apple Website Imitation

This project is a clone of the Apple website, focusing primarily on showcasing the iPhone with high-quality 3D modeling and animations. It's built using React and Vite for a modern, efficient development experience and is deployed on Vercel for global access.

## Features

- **3D Modeling of iPhone**: Utilizing Three.js, I've created 3D models of the iPhone to closely mimic the visual fidelity found on the official Apple website.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Animations are powered by GSAP, ensuring smooth and engaging transitions and interactions across the website.
- **Error Monitoring**: Integration with Sentry for real-time error tracking and monitoring, helping to maintain a high-quality user experience by quickly identifying and addressing potential issues.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that looks great on all devices, from mobile to desktop.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For building a dynamic user interface with reusable components.
- **Vite**: Leveraging Vite as our build tool for a fast development environment and optimized production builds.
- **Three.js**: Used for rendering 3D models of the iPhone in the web browser.
- **GSAP**: For creating smooth, performant animations across the website.
- **Sentry**: For error tracking and monitoring to ensure any issues are promptly identified and fixed.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: The project is hosted on Vercel, allowing for seamless deployment and high availability.
